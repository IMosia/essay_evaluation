# NLP approaches competition  
This project is final for Deep Learning course.  
It is based on [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learning-agency-lab-automated-essay-scoring-2/overview) but goes far beyond.  
It is dedicated to the Natural Language Processing problem: marking of essays, I tested various approaches starting from prediction score by length, to boosting, custom neural nets, BERT and moder LLM.  
The notebook with EDA, processing and analysis [final_pj_deep_learning.ipynb](https://github.com/IMosia/essay_evaluation/blob/main/final_pj_deep_learning.ipynb)
